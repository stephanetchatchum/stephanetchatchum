# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I’m an aspiring software engineer, focused on building strong fundamentals and practical skills through hands-on projects and consistent learning.

This profile and its repositories documents my journey as I grow across different areas of computer science and software engineering, including:

## 🔧 What I Work On
- **Data Structures & Algorithms🖥️** – building problem-solving depth and efficiency  
- **System Design🧠** – learning how real, scalable systems are structured  
- **Game Development🎮** – exploring interactive systems, mechanics, and engines  
- **Machine Learning🖥️** – experimenting with data-driven models and simulations  

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository serves as an overview of who I am as a developer and where I’m headed.  
You’ll find projects that emphasize:
- Clear logic and readable code  
- Incremental improvement over perfection  
- Learning by building, testing, and refining  

Some projects are experimental, some are more polished, but all represent genuine effort and growth.

## 🌱 My Approach
- Learn fundamentals deeply  
- Build real projects, not just examples  
- Stay curious and open to feedback  
- Improve consistently over time  

## 🤝 Collaboration & Feedback
I’m always open to learning from others, receiving constructive feedback, and collaborating on interesting ideas.  
If something here catches your attention, feel free to explore, open an issue, or reach out.
