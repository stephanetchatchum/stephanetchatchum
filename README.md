## Hi there 👋

<!--
**stephanetchatchum/stephanetchatchum** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Stephane and I’m an aspiring software engineer, steadily building strong foundations and real-world skills through hands-on projects.

This repository reflects my learning journey and growth across areas such as:

Data structures & algorithms🖥️

System design and problem-solving🧠

Game development and interactive systems🧑‍💻

Applied machine learning and experimentation📊

You’ll find projects that prioritize clear thinking, clean structure, and continuous improvement. Some are exploratory, some are practical, and all are part of a long-term goal: becoming a well-rounded engineer capable of building meaningful, reliable systems.

I’m always open to learning, feedback, and collaboration.
If something here sparks your interest, feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out 🙂
